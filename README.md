#  Spam-Email-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

A machine learning project that classifies emails or messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Python and TF-IDF vectorization.

## Overview
This project is a **Spam Mail Detector** that classifies emails or messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Machine Learning. It leverages the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** to train a model and uses **text preprocessing** and **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.  

The project is ideal for anyone looking to understand **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **text classification** using Python.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, stopwords removal)
- Text vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Test new emails for spam detection
- Optional improvements: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, n-grams, deep learning models
